/*
Write a function that, given:

1. an amount of money
2. an array of coin denominations

computes the number of ways to make the amount of money with
coins of the available denominations.

Example: for amount=(4¢) and denominations= [1,2,3] (1¢, 2¢ and 3¢),
your program would output 4—the number of ways to make 
4¢ with those denominations:

1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
1¢, 1¢, 2¢
1¢, 3¢
2¢, 2¢
